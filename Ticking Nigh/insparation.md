(i'm not asking for a solution or help I just want you to listen)

I frequently deal with this situation:
I try to sleep after staying up until two or three in the morning, and sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night because of something (a sudden light or noise, or even a bad dream), and then my entire body goes into hyper-alert mode, where everything feels extreme. My skin becomes itchy (not from an allergic reaction), my hearing becomes sensitive, and I can hear the ticking of the clock.
My body and mind get into this tug-of It's a psychological torment where my body is hypersensitive and my mind wants to sleep. I lose my temper, swear at myself, and slap myself across the face. Sometimes I laugh like a madman out of frustration. Like when your body goes through a lot of pain beyond its capability to handle, it triggers vomit Just like that, when your mind goes through trauma and grief beyond its capability to endure, it triggers laughter. My mind cannot cope with that sleep trauma, particularly when I have a big test the following day and need to get a full night's sleep but am unable to, and the stress of that makes it even more difficult to fall asleep.
