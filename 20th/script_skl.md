# **20th**

**INT. DORM ROOM – AFTERNOON**

_The ceiling fan whirs lazily. Sunlight leaks through dusty curtains. YAAD, 20, thin and tired-eyed, slouches on his bed. He stares at a 500 taka note in his hand like it’s the last piece of oxygen in a drowning world._

**PHONE RINGS.**
YAAD picks it up.

**BUA (V.O.)**
Hello, Yaad baba…

**YAAD**
Hello, Bua. Where are you? It’s almost 2 p.m.

**BUA (V.O.)**
Sorry, baba. I can’t come today. Emergency.

**YAAD**
Anything serious?

**BUA (V.O.)**
Not really. But I can’t come today.

**YAAD**
…Okay.

_The call cuts. Silence. His stomach growls._

**YAAD (V.O.)**
(Half muttering)
Now I have to go to a hotel for lunch.

_He folds the 500 tk, tucks it into his left pocket, and leaves._

---

**EXT. ROAD – DAY**

_The street bustles. Heat shimmers. YAAD walks, head low. He runs into FARHAD, a cheerful friend carrying a backpack._

**YAAD**
Hey, Farhad… do you have change for 500?

**FARHAD**
(Laughs) Change? Bro, I barely have bus fare.

**YAAD**
(Forces a smile) Ah… never mind.

_They part ways. YAAD walks on toward the roadside hotel._

---

**EXT. HOTEL FRONT – DAY**

_The hotel is loud, crowded with clinking plates and curry smells. YAAD pauses at the entrance, pats his pocket. His hand freezes. He checks the other pocket. Then all of them. Nothing._

**YAAD (V.O.)**
No… no, no. It’s here. I put it in here.

_DENIAL – He empties his bag, shakes it. Nothing._

**YAAD (V.O.)**
Maybe… maybe it slipped into another pocket.

_ANGER – His breath quickens. He curses under his breath._

**YAAD**
(Stammering in rage)
Why today? Why me? Damn it—damn Farhad! Damn Bua for not coming!

_BARGAINING – He slumps against the wall, sweating._

**YAAD (V.O.)**
If Farhad had change… at least I’d still have a hundred left. If only Bua hadn’t taken the day off…

_DEPRESSION – He lowers his head, holding his face in his hands._

**YAAD (V.O.)**
No… I spent it all. Recklessly. I’m the one to blame.

_ACCEPTANCE – He exhales sharply, exhausted._

**YAAD (V.O.)**
I lost the last bit I had. What more can I lose?

---

**EXT. QUIET SIDEWALK – DAY**

\*YAAD sits on a low wall, phone in hand. His thumb hovers over a contact: **FATHER.\***

**YAAD (V.O.)**
It’s the third time this month… Should I call?

_He dials. The screen shows “Calling…”. Before the first ring, he cuts it off. Silence again._

_He stares blankly ahead, hunger clawing at him. His eyes flicker with an idea._

---

**INT. STUDENT’S HOUSE – LATE AFTERNOON**

_A modest home. YAAD sits across from his student, tutoring math, though his voice is weak. The student’s MOTHER watches kindly from the doorway. A moment later—_

**MOTHER**
Yaad beta, you must be hungry. Stay and eat.

_She places a plate of rice and curry before him. YAAD hesitates, then begins eating. Slowly. Shame hangs over his posture. She notices._

_Close on his face as he chews. His eyes glisten, caught between gratitude and despair._

**YAAD (V.O.)**
Why me? What did I do wrong?
Am I on the right path?
If so… why does it feel so unbearable?

---

**FADE OUT.**

_The clink of a spoon against the plate echoes into silence._

**THE END.**
