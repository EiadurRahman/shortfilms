(HIGH ANGLE): Set on a table, Yaad just put his phone on the table, and the date is clear 20th September.

Yaad is doodling something on a notepad.

(YAAD (V.O.))

The month is about to end. Yet the wait feels longer than it should, especially when all you have is 500 tk you borrowed.
Dormitory walls feel closer than the people around you when you're a soul away from home.

    Bua (V.O.): Hello, Yaad Baba...
    Yaad: hello Bua, Where are you? It's almost 2pm?
    Bua (V.O.): Sorry, Baba, but I can't come today, it's an emergency.
    Yaad: Anything serious?
    Bua (V.O.): Not really, but I can't come today
    Yaad: Ok.
    (call cut...)

Yaad: Huh… Now I have to go to the canteen for lunch.

Yaad: OK.
(CONT'D) Yaad: Farhad!
Farhad: Hmm?
Yaad: Do you have 500 tk in change?

YAAD:
Fuck fuck fuck.... where the fuck I lost that note.
Bua had to take off today?

hits a rock in the ground

(CONT'D)YAAD:
If Farhad had some changes!!!

Yaad slows down and thinks to himself.

YAAD (V.O.):
Since I was the one who recklessly spent everything I had this month, why am I even pointing fingers at everyone?

Yaad took out his phone and dialed his father.
He hesitates to call.

YAAD (V.O.):
I should call him, but it's the third time in this month I'm asking for money.
Should I call him?

He calls Father, after the first ring he cuts the call

takes a deep breath

YAAD (V.O.):
I lost the last bit of money I had. What more can I lose?

He sits down and starts thinking.

Anty (motherly tone): What happened, Baba? Didn't like the food?
Yaad: (**fakes smile**) Nah, nothing like that. It's great actually, It reminds me of Maa.
Anty: Is it so? When you miss home, come over.
